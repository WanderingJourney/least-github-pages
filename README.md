## What this GitHub pages tutorial covers

This short GitHub how-to shows in a few pages how to:

* Join GitHub (it's free)
* Create a GitHub Pages project site
* Create web pages by typing using a convention called Markdown, which lets
you type `## Why use GitHub Pages?` and see it rendered as an HTML page,
as shown in the simliar headline below.
* Publish your pages as a website
* Link pages to other sites or other pages on your own site

## Why use GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is ideally suited for the creation of small-to-medium informational sites, 
especially technical documentation and other how-to subjects.

* It's free (for public sites)
* It's based on a simple approach to writing that emphasizes the text itself, with minimal
attention to formatting. It transforms simple text files into beautiful websites. You write the text files using a simple, 
natural set of conventions similar to the way many people format email. But
because it centers around text files, you can easily pick them up and move them to a different
content management system if don't like GitHub Pages
* GitHub Pages is built on top of Git and GitHub, a powerful version control combination.
Version control lets you roll back to earlier versions of a page (or the whole site)
if you make a mistake somewhere
* Because of the GitHub integration it's great for teams
* It's web-based, so you can start a page at home, then pick it up later a work without having to 
install any software or copy files manually
* It's ideally suited for simple read-only blogs

## When to avoid GitHub pages
