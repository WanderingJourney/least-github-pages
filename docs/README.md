View in [Github Pages](https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/) or directly on [Github](https://github.com/tomcam/least-github-pages/) 

This guide shows you how to create information-heavy websites quickly 
and interactively using GitHub Pages right on the GitHub website. You
don't need to learn command-line programs like Git or install anything
on your own computer.

GitHub Pages is free if your repository (file storage area) is public.

## What brought you here

If you were pointed to this site by an employer or well-meaning friend and aren't quite sure why, 
here are some reasons you this guide may help you.

* **The Least You Need to Know About GitHub Pages** shows you how to create a website using [GitHub](https://github.com),
which is normally thought of as a resource only for programmers. However, this guide requires no programming skills, use
of the command line, or knowledge of HTML and CSS (though the latter will help you as you grow). Everything is done
interactively on the GitHub website, and it's totally free. 
* All you need to know to create your website is how to type, with a
few exta characters thrown in to structure the document. For example, the heading to this paragraph was created by typing
`## What brought you here`. That's called a level 2 header. The heading to this page was created by typing
`# The Least You Need to Know About GitHub Pages`. That is of course a level 1 header. You create a link to
a site such as [Google](https://google.com) by typing `[Google](https://google.com)`. These are examples of an an industry-standard
format called *Markdown* or [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org).
* Your website can use [these free themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/) from GitHub.
* This guide will show you how to create structured informational websites of any size. "Informational" is an informal
way of saying that you have limited control over the visual appearance. Even so you'll be able to link to outside websites
and pages, link to interior pages and selected locations within those pages and use images, and handle simple formatting. 
* Nothing you do here will ever need to be thrown away. Should you decide that the limitations of GitHub pages are too severe,
you will lose none of your work. The Markdown pages you create can work with any other static site generator.


## Intended audience

but also briefly explains why you take each step.

## What you'll end up with

If you follow through the steps in this guide you'll have a small website showing everything you need to put up an attractive, easy to maintain site using words, links, and images. Not covered are advanced topics such as custom themes, SEO, advanced linking techniques, and so on.
