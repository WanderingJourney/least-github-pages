This guide shows you how to create information-heavy websites quickly

GitHub Pages is free if your repository (file storage area) is public.

## What brought you here

If you were pointed to this site by an employer or well-meaning friend and aren't quite sure why, 
plenty of reasons this guide may help you are in [Why Use GitHub Pages?](why-use-github-pages.md)

## Intended audience

GitHub Pages uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a publishing system based on the Ruby programming language. The Jekyll documentation is excellent, especially if you already know Jekyll, program in Ruby, and have both Ruby and Jekyll installed on your local computer. The GitHub Pages documentation is comprehensive and excellent--if you're already a Jekyll expert.

[The Least You Need to Know About GitHub Pages](./) is designed for people who don't happen to know Jekyll already but who need to get up to speed in GitHub Pages quickly to get a job done *now*. It tells you not only what to do step by step,
but also briefly explains why you take each step.

You probably don't want to use this guide to create GitHub Pages sites that require complex formatting. GitHub Pages uses Markdown. 
It uses Jekyll to turn that Markdown into HTML, based on the Jekyll theme you've chosen. Generally speaking this approach is
absolutely ideal for blogs, technical documents and instructional materials that require versioning and collaboration, where the
main work product is words and pictures. It is not a good fit for restaurant menu sites, consumer product sites, and so on where
custom formatting is the norm. 

## What you'll end up with

If you follow through the steps in this guide you'll have a small website showing everything you need to put up an attractive, easy to maintain site using words, links, and images. Not covered are advanced topics such as custom themes, SEO, advanced linking techniques, and so on.
