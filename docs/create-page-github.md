## Creating a page on GitHub.com

# TODO: Not finished

Create a page that looks something like this. It doesn't matter what you write,
as long as you start the first line with a hash tag and a space, like so: `# `

```
# Please start here

Thanks for using our product.
```

The `# ` signfies a level 1 header. The text underneath it is plain text.

Let's call this page done for now. 

* At the bottom of the page choose **Commit new file**.

You can optionally put a brief note in the top line (50 characters or less by convention)
and a longer explanation under it.

Github shows the page rendered as HTML:
