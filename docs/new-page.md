# Create a new page and link to it

Let's see how linking works by creating a second page, then linking to it from the first.

## Add a new page to the /docs directory

* Navigate back to your project directory by clicking the project name at the upper left of the page.

* Choose the `/doc` directory link. This is important because you don't want your
files to end up in the root directory.

* Choose **Create new file** and give it the name `tutorial.md`:

![Create a file named tutorial.md in the /docs directory](./assets/github-create-tutorial-md-file.png)

* Give it these contents:

```md
# Quick start tutorial

Here's how to get up and running as fast as possible.
We'll explain the details later.
```

* Move to the bottom of the page and choose **Commit changes** to save this file.

GitHub shows you the contents of the `/docs` directory. It should appear alongside README.md:
