## Creating a GitHub repository for your projects

The GitHub *repository*, also konwn as a *repo*, stores your project and its entire history. 
Git allows you to go back to any commit point and reconstruct your project up to that point.
On GitHub it also has many other features, such as an effective bug/feature reporting system
called Issues, a built-in Wiki, and easy ways for other people to check out their own
versions of your (public) repository and create their own versions, then offer them back
to you if they wish.

* Choose the **+** symbol, then **New repository** (or just click this [Create new repository](https://github.com/new) link).

The **Create a new repository** page appears.

On some configurations you may see the **Start a project** button, so click it if so.

* Give the repository a name. Normally it's best to use lowercase letters, numbers. Instead of spaces and hyphen characters (the minus sign, or `-`) instead. It will be used as a filename, and it will be given prominence in Web searches.

* Leave **Public** checked, then choose **Create repository**. Feel free to add a descripion if you wish.

That's it. Don't create a README. That will come in just a moment.
